### How to install a production version

#### Requirements
-   Apache 2.4
-   mod_wsgi 4.5.20 (installed with pip inside virtual environment)

It is assumed that we will be using Python inside a virtual environment where mod_wsgi is also installed.

#### Steps
1.  Enable your Apache server (check the manual how to do it for your OS)
2.  Locate the Apache config file, e.g. `/etc/httpd/httpd.conf` (the location and name may be different on your OS)
3.  run `mod_wsgi-express module-config` to get the `mod_wsgi` module configuration settings, e.g.,
    ```sh
    LoadModule wsgi_module "/home/user/virtualenvs/brapi/lib/python3.5/site-packages/mod_wsgi/server/mod_wsgi-py35.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so"
    WSGIPythonHome "/home/user/virtualenvs/brapi"
    ```
    You have to paste these two lines into your Apache configuration file.

    Note, however, that if you want to run different Python applications with different virtual environments, this approach cannot be used. In this case, you will have to use `mod_wsgi-express` to launch applications on different ports and configure a proxy. Check the `mod_wsgi` documentation how to accomplish that.
